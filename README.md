ðŸŸ¨We are facing on public data storage by allocating datacap.

ðŸŸ¨We have experience about data storage so that we can provide professional guidance.

### Allocation policy:

a. First allocation: max 5% (â‰¤256â€¯TiB)

b. Second allocation: 10%

c. Third allocationï¼š15%

d. Fourth allocationï¼š20%

e. Fifth and there after allocationï¼š25%

### Risk mitigation approach:

*First, we'll do KYC checks about client's identity, address, and source of funds.*

*Next, we'll turn to do risk assessment which associated with the client based on various factors such as their business activities, geographic location, and political exposure.*

*Then, we'll prepare some questions about Filecoin and data storage to clients. Once the above is verified, we will document and partially disclose it on github.*

### Dispute resolution process:

* Clients need give feedback in 5 days when dispute causes.
* We will give the result of dispute in 14 days if everything goes well.
* Based on actual case, we will give the treatment as below:
  *Pause allocation and await rectification*
  *Return unused Datacap*
  *End the allocation and mark the client*
